# Docker-IDE
This is a repo for a FDG Project: *Implementation of Cloud & Dockerization Technology in Computer Science Education*.

The goal is to deploy an IDE web app on local/remote server/VM using docker containers. Students in programming class can also access the IDE during the class and Q & A session.

## Plan
- Based on [Code Server](https://github.com/coder/code-server).
- Support dependencies for different programming languages
- Support VS Code extensions
- Build docker images
- Push on Docker Hub
